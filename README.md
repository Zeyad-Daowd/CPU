# 5-Stage Pipelined Processor in VHDL

This project implements a 5-stage pipelined processor using VHDL. The design includes all essential components of a processor pipeline: instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back stages. The processor supports an instruction set of 25 instructions, handling for interrupts, forwarding, and exception handling.
